**Project Report: Sorting Visualizer (Under Development)**

**1. Project Overview:**

The Sorting Visualizer project is a C++ application aimed at visually demonstrating various sorting algorithms. It provides users with an interactive platform to visualize the sorting process in real-time. The project is currently under development and is planned to be expanded to include additional sorting algorithms and enhanced visualization features.

**2. Problem and Solution Statement:**

The project addresses the challenge of understanding and visualizing the behavior of different sorting algorithms. Sorting algorithms are fundamental concepts in computer science, and visualizing their execution helps in comprehending their efficiency and performance characteristics. The Sorting Visualizer project offers a solution by providing a user-friendly interface to observe the sorting process step by step.

**3. Implementation Strategy:**

The project is implemented in C++ using the SDL library for graphics rendering. It utilizes various sorting algorithms such as bubble sort, insertion sort, merge sort, quick sort, and heap sort. The application generates a random array of integers and allows users to select a sorting algorithm to visualize. The sorting process is displayed graphically in real-time, with bars representing array elements being compared and swapped.

**4. Usage:**

- Users interact with the Sorting Visualizer through a command-line interface.
- Upon launching the application, users are prompted to initiate the sorting process by pressing the Enter key.
- Users can then select a sorting algorithm by entering the corresponding number from the provided options.
- The sorting process is visualized on the screen, allowing users to observe the algorithm's execution.
- Users can exit the application at any time by entering '-1' or pressing the Enter key.

**5. Features:**

- Real-time visualization of sorting algorithms.
- Support for multiple sorting algorithms, including bubble sort, insertion sort, merge sort, quick sort, and heap sort.
- Random generation of array elements for sorting.
- Interactive command-line interface for user interaction.
- Planned expansion to include additional sorting algorithms and visualization enhancements.

**6. Installation:**

The Sorting Visualizer project requires installation of the SDL library for graphics rendering. Additionally, a C++ compiler capable of compiling SDL-based programs is needed to build the project. The project files can be downloaded from the repository and compiled using the provided build instructions.

**7. Conclusion:**

The Sorting Visualizer project offers an educational tool for understanding sorting algorithms through visual representation. While currently under development, the project shows promise in providing an intuitive and interactive platform for exploring various sorting techniques. With planned expansions and enhancements, the Sorting Visualizer aims to become a comprehensive resource for learning and experimenting with sorting algorithms.
